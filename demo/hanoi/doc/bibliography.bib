                  that methodology, the author defines extensions of
                  the implicit place transformation and the pre and
                  post agglomeration of transitions. For each
                  reduction it is proved that the reduced net has
                  exatcly the same properties as the origianl
                  net. Finally the author completely reduces an

                  of a variable or a gate as follows: $level(root)=0$
                  and $level(f)=max(level(g))+1$, where the $g$'s are
                  the fathers of $f$. The first heuristics consists in
                  indexing the variables according to the decreasing
                  order of their levels. The justification is that the
                  influence of variables high in the circuit must be
                  computed as soon as possible. \item Same as the
                  previous heuristics but respecting modules. Modules
                  are treated in the decreasing order of their
                  depths. The depth of a formula being the maximum
                  depth of its variables. \end{enumerate} Experimental
                  results are reported, showing that the second
                  heuristics is very good (on the ICSAS'85
                  benchmark). Lu },

                  BDD nodes via a hash table is proposed (and thus the
                  reduction operation is suppressed). Then, various
                  labelling of edges are discussed: first, the flag
                  $+/-$ already proposed by Billon and Madre
                  \cite{Bil87,MB88}. Second, another flag so-called
                  input inverter, is proposed. It transforms
                  $ite(x,F,G)$ into $ite(\neg
                  x,F,G)=ite(x,G,F)$. Canonicity is maintained by
                  keeping only nodes such that $F<G$ (for say the
                  memory order). Third, labelling edges with shifts
                  between variable indices is proposed. Fourth, it is
                  proposed to encode small BDD's (with only two
                  variables) by means of a single word. Then, a
                  variable ordering heuristics is proposed. It
                  consists in propagating a flow from the outputs to
                  the inputs of the circuits and labelling inputs by
                  the order of their flow values. The flow at each
                  input is $1.0$, the flow at a gate is the sum of its
                  in-flow. Its is shared equally by its parents. Then,
                  A way to manage {\em don't care} parts of circuits
                  is proposed. It consists in using a second variable
                  $\neg x_1 \wedge \neg x_2 \rightarrow \neg x$, $x_1
                  \wedge x_2 \rightarrow x$, otherwise {\em don't
                  care}. Finally, experimental results are reported. },
