	* INST_STL removed from build (was broken with gcc > 3.3 anyway)

version 1.3 : May 2007. Release includes support for additive Edge valued DDD and SDD
	* various cleanups and rewrites for compliance with gcc >= 4.1
	* minor updates to allow build on 64 bit architectures
	* added tests using uttk

Version 1.1 : November 2004. First semi-public release of the libDDD. Release includes SDD.
	* Uses autotools for build procedure, tested on Mac, linux, cygwin.
	* Compiles in three variants : 
	** libddd.a, the optimized version, 
	** libddd_d.a version with debugging symbols activated, 
	** libddd_otfg.a a version with experimental on the fly garbage collection
	* Optionally, using gcc in versions 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, it is possible to activate build of INST_STL version, modify src/Makefile.am for this.
