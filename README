To build, simply run

./configure
make

By default, the library "src/libddd.a" is built using optimized flags.

Some options you can activate to build other library variants :

--enable-debug : activates build of debug versions of all libraries activated : src/libddd_d.a src/libddd_mt_d.a src/libddd_par_d.a etc..

--enable-evddd : activates build of edge valued variant of library "src/libddd_ev.a". Currently built in non reentrant mode.

Multi-threaded and reentrant variants below require the open-source library Threading Building Blocks TBB from intel. If this library is not installed in your system folders, you should specify include path using the CPPFLAGS variable. 

For instance, if tbb was built in /home/scott/tbb/ :

./configure --enable-reentrant CPPFLAGS="-I /home/scott/tbb/include"

--enable-reentrant : activates build of reentrant library version "src/libddd_mt.a", adapted to multi-threaded applications.

--enable-parallel : activates build of internally "src/libddd_par.a" multi-threaded variant. Saturation procedures then run faster on multi-core architectures. User programs can try this variant interchangeably with the default version. However, flag -D PARALLEL_DD must be defined when including libddd headers.
